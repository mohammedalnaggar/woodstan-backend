# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
*Any failing gate requires a justified entry in the Complexity Tracking table.*

| # | Principle Gate | Status | Notes |
|---|----------------|--------|-------|
| I | Structured Data Is the System of Record — No geometry parsing; all inputs are typed parametric records; Blender import discards mesh data at the boundary | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| II | All Outputs Must Be Deterministic — Engine functions are pure; no hidden state, randomness, or timestamps in output generation | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| III | Manufacturing Constraints Are First-Class Validation — Validation runs before generation; invalid inputs rejected with specific errors; no silent bad output | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| IV | Construction Methods Drive Dimension Resolution — Each method has its own resolver; no universal formula; changing method produces different dimensions | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| V | Every Part Is Fully Traceable — All parts carry deterministic identifiers encoding project+unit+role; no anonymous parts in any output | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| VI | Generated Outputs Are Immutable and Versioned — No in-place mutation of generated parts; parameter changes produce new snapshots; exports include version/hash | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |
| VII | Dual-Input Parity — UI-defined and Blender-imported units share identical schema, validators, resolvers, and generation logic; parity tests exist | PASS / FAIL / N/A | |

**Pre-Phase-0 Gate Result**: [ ] All gates PASS or justified in Complexity Tracking
**Post-Phase-1 Re-check Result**: [ ] All gates PASS or justified in Complexity Tracking

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
